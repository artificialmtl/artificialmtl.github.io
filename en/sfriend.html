    <h2 id="quoi">About Sarah Friend</h2>

    <p>

Sarah Friend (@isthisanart_) is an artist and software engineer working at a large blockchain development studio. When not doing that, she creates games and other interactive experiences. Her practice investigates murky dichotomies - like those between privacy and transparency, centralization and decentralization, and the environment and technology - with playfulness and absurdist humour. She is a proud Recurse Center alum, and has recently presented at Radical Networks in Berlin, Microwave Festival in Hong Kong, and Ethereum Devcon in Prague.  She was recently chosen as one of Canada's 30 under 30 developers, is one of the organizers of Our Networks, a conference on all aspects of the distributed web in Toronto.</p>
