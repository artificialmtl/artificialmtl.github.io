    <h2 id="quoi">About Tom White</h2>

    <p>

Tom White studied computer graphics and design at the MIT Aesthetics and Computation
group with professor John Maeda. At MIT, he was one of the authors of the ACU library
which both influenced the design of the Processing framework and would also later become
the basis of the OpenFrameworks library. Tom has exhibited computational art at venues
including SIGGRAPH, Ars Electronica, Cooper Union, MoMA, National Taiwan Museum of
Fine Arts, Nature Morte Gallery, and NIPS. His most recent work investigates computer
perception by creating abstract prints that are engineered to be meaningful to modern
computer vision algorithms.
More information about Tom’s current work can be found in his recent online essays
